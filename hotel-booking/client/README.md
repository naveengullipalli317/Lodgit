# Setup needed

  - we have two folders, one is API and one is client, api folder contains the code related to backend and client folder contains related to the frontend. 
    
    To run Backend Code:
  - you need to go the api folder by typing this command ,  "cd api/" then run "npm install" and then "npm start"

 - open an other window and start the frontend with these comamnds. 

     cd client/
     npm install
     npm start

 Note: Both should run parallel. 

 - and to maintain your database, go the mongoConnection.js file and replace the connection string with yours. you can create it through mongoAtlas

- we are sending email through our emails, you can change it in the booking.js file. so it will go through your email address.
